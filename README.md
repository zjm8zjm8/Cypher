# Cypher
The Cypher Game!

This is mainly an attempt to hone programming skills.  I think it's fun to make games, and I wanted to make this one big.
Please don't steal this. It's fine to download a copy to show to friends, but eventually I'll want to sell this.

If you have re-organizational tips or you want to make an improvement, shoot me a message at zjm8zjm8@gmail.com.
I'm trying to build everything (art, music) from scratch, but if you'd like to contribute with assets, I'm happy to see them.

Thanks!
